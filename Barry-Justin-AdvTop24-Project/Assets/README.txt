**CONTENT WARNING-ESQUE CAMERA SYSTEM**

A small tech demo of recording actual footage ingame as seen, instead of the traditional method of simulating what happened through telemetry.
Press left click to record.
Scroll wheel to adjust zoom, and middle click to reset it.
Press "E" to drop a mouse for the fox to find. 

Inside this project are two folders - "the FoxNPC" folder can be ignored as this is simply present for the FoxNPC project we did last year, 
an NPC I decided to include in order to give the player something to film - It helps in demonstrating the functionality of the camera.
